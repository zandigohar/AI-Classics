# AI codes from simple to advanced

Machine Learning Scripts and Reports:

I have uploaded some course projects done with artificial intelligence here, including: 

<ul>
  <li>Breast Cancer Prediction</li>
  <li>Markvo Models (MM) </li>
  <li>Hidden Morkov Models (HMM)</li>
  <li>Handwritten Digit Classification</li>
</ul>  

The codes are all  written in Python. 

You may need to install some packages to run the code including 'sklearn' and 'pomegranate'.

Please read the README.md for each of the directories for more details.
